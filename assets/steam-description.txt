[b][i]DEPRECATED:[/i][/b] Paradox has applied a similar fix in 3.1.1 "Lem" - if you have that version or higher, you do not need this mod.  It remains listed for players who choose to play in the 3.0.* "Dick" versions of Stellaris.

[h1]Overview[/h1]

Are you tired of not being able to protect the Space Amoebas and the Tiyanki at the same time?  Then this mod is for you!

[h1]Changes[/h1]

This mod replaces the [i]resolution_categories\00_resolution_categories.txt[/i] file that defines most of the Galactic Community
resolutions categories.  The only change is to add the tag [i]multiple_active_resolutions = yes[/i] to the Space Fauna category.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
 
Because it replaces a core Stellaris file, this mod is inherently incompatible with any other mods that overwrite the same file.
If another mod only changes resolution categories for the Galactic Custodian/Galactic Imperium then it might be compatible with this one -
those live in a different file.  If another mod only changes the resolutions themselves, it should be compatible with this one.

This mod is not compatible with achievements because it overwrites a core Stellaris file.

[h3]When to Install[/h3]

This mod can be safely added or removed from your savegame after the game has started.  It alters a single game object, but will not negitively impact your savegame.  If you remove it, your game will work normally.
