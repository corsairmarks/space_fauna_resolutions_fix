# Overview

Are you tired of not being able to protect the Space Amoebas and the Tiyanki at the same time?  Then this mod is for you!

# Changes

This mod replaces the `common/resolution_categories/00_resolution_categories.txt` file that defines most of the Galactic Community
resolutions categories.  The only change is to add the tag `multiple_active_resolutions = yes` to the Space Fauna category.

## Compatibility
 
Because it replaces a core Stellaris file, this mod is inherently incompatible with any other mods that overwrite the same file.
If another mod only changes resolution categories for the Galactic Custodian/Galactic Imperium then it might be compatible with this one -
those live in a different file.  If another mod only changes the resolutions themselves, it should be compatible with this one.

This mod is not compatible with achievements because it overwrites a core Stellaris file.

### Post-Game Start

This mod can be safely added or removed from your savegame after the game has started.  It alters a single game object, but will not negitively impact your savegame.  If you remove it, your game will work normally.

## Changelog

* 1.0.0 Initial version
* 1.0.1 Flagged as compatible with Stellaris 3.0.* (no script changes)
* 1.0.2 Update README, remove extra image to keep distribution lightweight (no script changes)

### Development Notes

It is best to clone this repository into `<Stellaris User's Directory>/Paradox Interactive/Stellaris/mod`, and then make a connection to the `mod` folder via a `*.mod` file's `path` property.  That will ensure the game can see the files, and also that CWTools will parse them.  Also note that the README.md file exists in the `mod` directory but is symbolically linked in the root directory.
